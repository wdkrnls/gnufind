```

## Purpose

This package provides a simple wrapper using `system2` for calling [GNU Find](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/).

## Hello World

Let's see all the R files we've modified in the last hour. But we don't want to see any the were generated in .Rcheck folders.

```{r example}
library(gnufind)
fs <- gnu_find(search_path = "~", 
               name = "*.R", 
               type = "f", 
               newermt = "1 hour ago",
               cmp = not(path = "*Rcheck*"))
```

`cmp` is a shorthand for making a `compound` statement. The three kinds of compound statements built-in are `or`, `and`, and `not`. New compound statements can be generated using `compound`.
